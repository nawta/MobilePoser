## Installation 
We recommend configuring the project inside an Anaconda environment. We have tested everything using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) version 23.9.0 and Python 3.9. The first step is to create a virtual environment, as shown below (named `mobileposer`).
```
conda create -n mobileposer python=3.9
```
You should then activate the environment as shown below. All following operations must be completed within the virtual environment.
```
(conda init)
(source ~/.bashrc)
conda activate mobileposer
```
Then, install the required packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You will then need to install the local mobileposer package for development via the command below. You must run this from the root directory (e.g., where setup.py is).
```
pip install -e .
```

## Process Datasets

### Download Training Data
1. Register and download the AMASS dataset from [here](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/). We use 'SMPLH+G' for each dataset. 
2. Register and download the DIP-IMU dataset from [here](https://dip.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/). Download the raw (unormalized) data.
3. Request access to the TotalCapture dataset [here](https://cvssp.org/data/totalcapture/). Download Vicon Groundtruth in the raw folder, and IMU data in the IMU folder. 
4. Download the IMUPoser dataset from [here](https://github.com/FIGLAB/IMUPoser).
5. The Nymeria dataset can be accessed from [here](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/nymeria/). The dataset is structured as described in the [nawta/nymeria_dataset](https://github.com/nawta/nymeria_dataset) repository.

Once downloaded, your directory might appear as follows:

### Setup Training Data 
In `config.py`: 
- Set `paths.processed_datasets` to the directory containing the pre-processed datasets.
- Set `paths.raw_amass` to the directory containing the AMASS dataset.
- Set `paths.raw_dip` to the directory containing the DIP dataset.
- Set `paths.raw_imuposer` to the directory containing the IMUPoser dataset.
- Set `paths.raw_nymeria` to the directory containing the Nymeria dataset.
  
The script `process.py` drives the dataset pre-processing. This script takes the following parameters:
1. `--dataset`: Dataset to pre-process (`amass`, `dip`, `imuposer`, `nymeria`). Defaults to `amass`.

As an example, the following commands will pre-process the DIP and Nymeria datasets:
```
$ python process.py --dataset dip
((mobileposer) root@43469fc1d10a:~/workspace# python mobileposer/process.py --dataset dip)

$ python process.py --dataset nymeria
```

## Training Models 
The script `train.py` drives the training process. This script takes the following parameters:
1. `--module`: Train an individual module (`poser`, `joints`, `foot_contact`, `velocity`). Default to training all modules. 
2. `--init-from`: Initialize training from an existing checkpoint. Defaults to training from scratch. 
3. `--finetune`: Specify dataset for finetuning module (e.g., `dip`). 
4. `--fast-dev-run`: A boolean flag that caps the execution to a single epoch. This flag is useful for debugging.

As an example, we can execute the following command to train all modules: 
```
$ python train.py
```

### Finetuning Model
To facilitate finetuning MobilePoser, we provide a script `finetune.sh`. To run this script, use the following syntax: 
```
$ ./finetune.sh <dataset-name> <checkpoint-directory>
```

### Prepare Model
The script `combine_weights.py` combines the weights of individual modules into a single weight file that can be loaded into `MobilePoserNet`. 
To run this script, use the following syntax: 
```
$ python combine_weights.py --finetune <dataset-name> --checkpoint <checkpoint-directory>
```
Omit the `--finetune` argument if you did not finetune. The resulting weight file will be stored under the same directory as the `checkpoint-directory>`


### Download pre-trained network weights
We provide a pre-trained model for the set of configurations listed in `config.py`. 
1. Download weights from [here](https://uchicago.box.com/s/ey3y49srpo79propzvmjx0t8u3ael6cl). 
2. In `config.py`, set the `paths.weights_file` to the model path.

### Run Evaluation
The script `evaluate.py` drives model evaluation. This script takes the following arguments. 
1. `--model`: Path to the trained model.
2. `--dataset`: Dataset to execute testing on (e.g., `dip`, `imuposer`, `totalcapture`, `nymeria`).
   
As an example, we can execute the following concrete commands:
```
$ python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/weights.pth --dataset dip
$ python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/weights.pth --dataset nymeria
```

### Visualizing Results 
To visualize the prediction results of the trained model, we provide a script `example.py`. This script takes the following arguments. 
1. `--model`: Path to the trained model.
2. `--dataset`: Dataset to execute prediction for visualization. Defaults to `dip`.
3. `--seq-num`: Sequence nuber of dataset to execute prediction. Defaults to 1.
4. `--with-tran`: A boolean flag to enable visualizing translation estimation. Defaults to False. 
5. `--combo`: Device-location combination. Defaults to 'lw_rp' (left-wrist right-pocket).
   
Additionally, you can set the GT environment variable to customize visualization modes:
- GT=1: Visualizes both predictions and ground-truth.
- GT=2: Visualizes only the ground-truth data.

As an example, we can execute the following concrete command:
```
$ GT=1 python example.py --model checkpoints/weights.pth --dataset dip --seq-num 5 --with-tran
```

Note, we recommend using your local machine to visualize the results.
